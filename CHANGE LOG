CHANGE LOG:

I created a new print specific stylesheet. I changed colors to match our styles and cut out a lot of features (more may need to be cut)

Original (now web) stylesheet is called map-style-web.ymla

Print stylesheet is called map-style-print.ymla

Changed 2 functions in app.js

ShowWeb
Added "-web" to    scene.load('map-styles-web.yaml');

ShowPrint
Deleted first two lones that change styles
Added:     scene.load('map-styles-print.yaml');



(Also had to rename ymla file (add web) in var quietLAlayer )


USEAGE:

Use web to create quick web maps
Use print to create print basemaps. Turn off labels.
